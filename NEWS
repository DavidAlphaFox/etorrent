Version 0.1 ALPHA:

  This is the ALPHA-version of eTorrent. As of now, almost nothing
  works. It is more to be seen as an early adopters piece of software
  which you can read code and comment. If you want a working
  bittorrent client that doesn't need gentle coercion from the user,
  wait until the release of the 1.0 Version.

  In between this Alpha and the 1.0 will be a series of BETAs. When
  the BETAs hit the fan, I would like to get Issues through the
  code.google.com bug tracker.
