** INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **

FOR NOW, READ THE README FILE AND FOLLOW THAT. THIS IS HOW I
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE OVER TIME.

DARK IN HERE, ISN'T IT?

------------------------------------------------------------
Rather than a long GNU-version, here is the summary:

./configure; make; make install

** RUNNING **

Edit the configuration file to suit your setup.

run the bin/etorrent shell-script:

${PREFIX}/bin/etorrentctl start

** STOPPING **

${PREFIX}/bin/etorrentctl stop
