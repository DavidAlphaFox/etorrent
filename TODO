* Fix connection_manager
We need to fix the state code for the connection manager. It has some
state tables that obviously needs to be managed. But it has to be
simplified a lot. And it really can. Mapping of pids to torrents and
peerids should be handled by a separate process which only has this as
the primary goal.

* Reduce the number of ets tables
Fix and reduce the number of ets tables to a constant amount. This
will allow us to scale into post-1000 concurrent torrents.

* Add license facts

* Add author facts

* Kill -compile(export_all) and use -export.
