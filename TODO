----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- This is a list of what To Do before a release is ready to be made.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Rename etorrent to etorrent_sup.

* Fix the missing mkdir of lib/etorrent-1.0/ebin.

* Revamp etorrent_t_manager.

* DOCUMENTATION!
- Pick functions at random, and document what they are doing.
  It is /especially/ important to document library calls and
   non-standard internal functions in OTP modules.

------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION ++ (Not decided yet)
------------------------------------------------------------
* Use Edoc
- This takes time, so pick a single module at a time and correct it

* TorrentPeerMaster
- Figure out a better choking/unchoking algorithm.
  The current algorithm is the original one. We should look for a
   better algorithm and implement that. Suggestions for digging:
     ** Azureus
     ** Mainline
     ** Bittornado
     ** rtorrent

* Cleanups
- Decide what to do if we connect multiply to the same IP

* Temporary IP-ban on errors
  If we find an error on a given peer, ban him temporarily for some
   time.

* ROBUSTNESS
- What happens if process X dies
  Go through all processes, and think about what happens if it
   dies. Ensure that the system is robust.
