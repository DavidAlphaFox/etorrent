-- This is a list of what To Do before a release is ready to be made.
--   Keep the style please. Can be read with emacs org-mode
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* We seem to be passing around a master_pid we are not using anymore.
  Consider killing this master pid!

* Consider making the histogram into mnesia
  Rather than using a histogram as it is now, rewrite it into mnesia
  tables. This would, hopefully, make for some much better code that
  is smaller than now. Looks like the piecemap would already be there
  in file_access, and the histogram list can easily be added I think.

* We are currently ignoring the endgame. This can be fixed easily though.

* Only count downloaded bytes when we _know_ the bytes are from the torrent in question

* DOCUMENTATION!
- Pick functions at random, and document what they are doing.
  It is /especially/ important to document library calls and
   non-standard internal functions in OTP modules.

VERSION ++ (Not decided yet)
------------------------------------------------------------


* Use Edoc
- This takes time, so pick a single module at a time and correct it


* TorrentPeerMaster
- Figure out a better choking/unchoking algorithm.
  The current algorithm is the original one. We should look for a
   better algorithm and implement that. Suggestions for digging:
     ** Azureus
     ** Mainline
     ** Bittornado
     ** rtorrent


* Cleanups
- Decide what to do if we connect multiply to the same IP


* Temporary IP-ban on errors
  If we find an error on a given peer, ban him temporarily for some
   time.


* ROBUSTNESS
- In general, robustness is not really taken care of. We ought to make
  the system more robust by not relying so much on Pids etc.
- What happens if process X dies
  Go through all processes, and think about what happens if it
   dies. Ensure that the system is robust.
