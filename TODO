----------------------------------------------------------------------

* We seem to be passing around a master_pid we are not using anymore.
  Consider killing this master pid!

* We are currently ignoring the endgame. This can be fixed easily though.
  The endgame is not handled at all. We do check for the endgame
  however. We should then alter the piece picking strategy a
  bit. We just pick out all eligible chunks for a peer first and then
  pick the required number of chunks randomly.

* Use highwatermark/lowwatermark for queued pieces.
  Rather than queue new pieces one at a time, we could just queue on
  some watermarks. This lowers the amount of code traversed a great
  deal. Also: it paves the way for maintaining queue length as a
  bandwidth*delay product like construction.

* Only count downloaded bytes when we _know_ the bytes are from the torrent in question


* DOCUMENTATION!
- Pick functions at random, and document what they are doing.
  It is /especially/ important to document library calls and
   non-standard internal functions in OTP modules.

* TorrentPeerMaster
- Figure out a better choking/unchoking algorithm.
  The current algorithm is the original one. We should look for a
   better algorithm and implement that. Suggestions for digging:
     ** Azureus
     ** Mainline
     ** Bittornado
     ** rtorrent


* Cleanups
- Decide what to do if we connect multiply to the same IP


* Temporary IP-ban on errors
  If we find an error on a given peer, ban him temporarily for some
   time.


* ROBUSTNESS
- In general, robustness is not really taken care of. We ought to make
  the system more robust by not relying so much on Pids etc.
- What happens if process X dies
  Go through all processes, and think about what happens if it
   dies. Ensure that the system is robust.
