MANTRA: Handle most of the stuff in the torrent_peer code before
moving on to other parts. What is made here dictates the layout of the
rest of the code.

MANTRA: ets tables have processes before them to manage them easily.

UNDECIDED: Merge filesystem and piecemap into the same erlang process?

* Split out torrent_peer_send into its own thread.
Doing this will greatly simplify code to a simpler format so we are
keeping ourselves below the 400 lines of code per module limit.

* Set torrent_id in torrent_peer
We have added torrent_id to the torrent peer code. But we have not
given it any value yet.

* Fix connection_manager
We need to fix the state code for the connection manager. It has some
state tables that obviously needs to be managed. But it has to be
simplified a lot. And it really can. Mapping of pids to torrents and
peerids should be handled by a separate process which only has this as
the primary goal.

* Choke/Unchoke management
We need to manage choke and unchoke

* Filesystem management
We need FS management

* Local requests at other end.
...

* Reduce the number of ets tables
Fix and reduce the number of ets tables to a constant amount. This
will allow us to scale into post-1000 concurrent torrents.

* Add license facts

* Add author facts

* Kill -compile(export_all) and use -export.
