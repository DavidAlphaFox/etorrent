* FileSystem
Seems to be smartest to split it into multiple processes since the
death of a single process won't hurt everything then. If there is only
1 filesystem, a crash means a complete restart of everything. If there
are 1 per torrent, we only have to crash the torrent. Much less
impact. Much better.
