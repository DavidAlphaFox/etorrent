%% @doc File handle state machine.
%%
%% <p>
%% State machine that wraps a file-handle and exposes an interface
%% that enables clients to read and write data at specified offsets.
%% An previously unstated benefit of using a server process to wrap
%% a file handle is that the file handle is cached and reused. This
%% reduces the number of open file handles to at most one per file
%% instead of requiring one file handle per concurrent request.
%% </p>
%%
%% <p>
%% The state machine is a simple model of the open/closed state of the
%% file handle which simplifies request handling and reduces the average
%% number of calls sent to the directory server. The worst case is still
%% at least one call to request permission to open the file.
%% </p>
