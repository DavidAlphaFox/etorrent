-- ETORRENT --

ETORRENT is a bittorrent client written in Erlang. The focus is on
robustness and scalability in number of torrents rather than in pure
speed. ETORRENT is mostly meant for unattended operation, where one
just specifies what files to download and gets a notification when
they are.

ETORRENT was mostly conceived as an experiment in how easy it would be
to write a bittorrent client in Erlang. The hypothesis is that the
code will be cleaner and smaller than comparative bittorrent clients.

-- GETTING STARTED --

1. run 'make -f Makefile.init'. This calls autoconf and friends.
2. run './configure'
3. run 'make'
4. cd into lib/etorrent-1.0/ebin
5. copy /etc/etorrent.config into the ebin dir and edit it to your liking.
   Note that the directory for watching torrents and the directory for
   error logs should exist (or things get nasty).
6. run 'erl -pa . -config etorrent.config -sname etorrent -s etorrent_app'
7. drop a .torrent file in the watched dir and see what happens.

-- REPORTING BUGS --

Google has an issue tracker at:

Use that for bug reports. I'll get to them as soon as I can.
