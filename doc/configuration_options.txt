This document describes the various configuration options of
etorrent.

* port: This is the port which etorrent should listen on for incoming
  connections. By default it is the taxicab number 1729, but it can of
  course be changed. We don't need a range of ports because we will
  find out what torrent we are transferring in the handshake.

* dir: The directory to place .torrent files in and the directory to
  which torrent files will be downloaded.

* logger_dir: The directory of the etorrent log file
* logger_fname: The name of the log file. It is *not* currently
  rotated and it is appended upon. The format is a simple term-log.

You don't need to touch the kernel parameters.

The SASL parameters can be uncommented to give you a SASL error
log. For development this is good because you can leave the client on
for a while and then come back to see if it has produced any kind of
errors.
